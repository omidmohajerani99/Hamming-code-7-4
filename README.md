## Hamming code(7,4): Encoding & decoding (correcting one noise) in python
### 0.What is hamming code(7,4)?
 Hamming(7,4) is a linear error-correcting code that encodes four bits of data into seven bits by adding three parity bits and after decoding can find two errors and fix one error. It is a member of a larger family of Hamming codes.
